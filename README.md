My name is ishPLC©️, and this is my personally registered mark since 2006. All rights reserved.
A little about me: I previously worked as an electronics engineer and a C/C++ programmer. After retiring, I've embarked on a new chapter - dedicating myself to what I love: design and art.
My hobby has smoothly evolved into a wonderful world of creativity. Here, I will gradually share new design possibilities and my works.
I invite you, my dear reader and viewer, to this exciting adventure! Follow me!
